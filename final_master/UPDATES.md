The Neuron Syndicate CMS Update file.<br><br>

12/16/2013<br>
Created this repository.<br><br>

Project Status: All of the logic is present.<br>
                TODO: Sewing it all together.<br>
                TODO: Get sample files from Neuron Syndicate.<br>
                TODO: Test all functions in general - in particular the folder creation or folder upload.<br>
                TODO: Try to break it - may need Eric ;)<br><br>


Project Logic:  The folder "final_master" has a PHP function to add an empty directory or upload an existing directory.<br>
                Every folder has the same PHP function. So you can create a folder inside of a folder inside of a folder.<br><br>
                

CMS Integration:  Once tested, get together with Matt, do a walk through. Adjust to any issues Matt sees.<br>
                  Reduce the necessity of using the CMS unless the function needed is only doable via the CMS.<br><br>
                  
                  
CMS Timeline: Beta test available on 12/20/2013.<br>
              Matt can test on his end either before or after the Holidays.<br><br>
              
              Get out the Hookah and celebrate!
