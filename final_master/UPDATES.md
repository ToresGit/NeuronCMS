The Neuron Syndicate CMS Update file.

12/16/2013
Created this repository.

Project Status: All of the logic is present.
                TODO: Sewing it all together.
                TODO: Get sample files from Neuron Syndicate.
                TODO: Test all functions in general - in particular the folder creation or folder upload.
                TODO: Try to break it - may need Eric ;)


Project Logic:  The folder "final_master" has a PHP function to add an empty directory or upload an existing directory.
                Every folder has the same PHP function. So you can create a folder inside of a folder inside of a folder.
                

CMS Integration:  Once tested, get together with Matt, do a walk through. Adjust to any issues Matt sees.
                  Reduce the necessity of using the CMS unless the function needed is only doable via the CMS.
                  
                  
CMS Timeline: Beta test available on 12/20/2013.
              Matt can test on his end either before or after the Holidays.
              
              Get out the Hookah and celebrate!
